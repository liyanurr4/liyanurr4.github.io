<p>Traditionally, the head bridesmaid travels to the ceremony in the same car as the bride’s mother and the other bridesmaids. This short bridesmaid hairstyle is an amazing option if you don’t have the long hair to do other styles. Keep in mind, what may work for one bridesmaid�s hair type may not work for another. If you buy bridesmaid jewelry that match the style and personality of each attendant — rather than your wedding colors or their bridesmaid dress — they are more likely to wear it for years to come.</p>

<p>It�s customary for all of the bachelorette party guests (including the bridesmaids) to pitch in to cover the bride�s expenses. Btw it seems a bit unusual to me that you�re being asked to wear your hair a certain way. For example, if the bride is wearing a pearl and diamond necklace, the bridesmaids will look stunning in a simple strand of pearls. They should have the option to do their own hair if they have to pay for it. As long as it’s not something as extreme as 8 bridesmaids to 1 groomsmen, having a number that’s relatively close (and i think half qualifies as that), then you’re totally fine. This is up to your guest of honor, so be sure to check with them first.</p>
