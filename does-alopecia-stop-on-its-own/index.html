<p>The less hair loss you have, the more likely it is that your hair will regrow on its own. In short, it could be due to stress, hormones or lifestyle factors…the good news is though, that alopecia does not have to be permanent. In rare cases, hair is eventually lost from the entire scalp, called alopecia totalis. There are also those which are not curable such as female pattern baldness and alopecia areata. It’s not contagious, but it can be devastating for people who suffer from persistent bald patches or general loss of all their body hair. Alopecia areata can’t be prevented because its cause is unknown.</p>
