</center> <p><strong>Can I Start Dreadlocks With Relaxed Hair</strong>, Dreads can be started on all natural hairs and textures provided you have the required length. Create dreadlocks in uneven hair or only on part of your scalp if a mixed style looks good on you. The beginning of the process starts with coils being wrapped around sectioned strands of hair.</p>

<p>Perming is a chemical process that often has some negative consequences as well. It is highly recommended for starting dreads with short hair. Starting dreads with way too little hair in each dread (2/8 sections or something crazy) will quickly lead to problems as the dreads get longer and heavier. If you want to achieve that instant appearance of mature dreadlocks, then this one is for you.</p>

<p>Wash your hair with a shampoo that is appropriate for your hair type (dry, oily, normal). I wouldn�t blame you for wearing beanies or tams often though if you feel conscious about it, it would also stop the wind from making your head cold! Many people will argue that all relaxed hair is detrimentally unhealthy, which i personally disagree with. The process of twisting the hair into dreads puts a considerable amount of stress on the hair. Create dreadlocks in uneven hair or only on part of your scalp if a mixed style looks good on you. On super curly hair, while you could start on hair about 3 inches, you want to keep as much of the hair when you begin.</p>
