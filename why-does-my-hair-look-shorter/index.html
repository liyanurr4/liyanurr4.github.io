<p>Long hair usually pulls curls and ripples, making them more elastic, but shorter hair will help your hair get in shape. Also, the length and shaping of a bob can be used to accentuate (or downplay) your features. My hair is pretty thin and very straight, so layers were a great way for me to fake having thicker hair. I�ve gone from almost bra strap to shoulder length in two and a half months! The soft curls i had before are gone. Extensions add fullness to the hair and hair will look healthier and shinier too… which helps make you look younger.</p>
