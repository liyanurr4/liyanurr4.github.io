<center>Why is my hair like this curlyhair From reddit.com</center>
<p>As determined by the professional hair stylist, bob hair is one of the least fussy hairstyles, it is almost suited for most different faces and when my hair is straight on top and curly on bottom. If hair is all one length, the curls just compete for space and crowd each other, bunched at the bottom. The back/bottom layer was the worst, sometimes turning up completely straight, or with random loops in an otherwise plain piece of hair, versus the ringlets going on up top. I noticed pretty early that the ends of my hair.</p>

Each curl consists of different amounts of hair and has different elasticity or spring factor so it�s best to address each curl separately. Also my hair is really curly at the front but if you look at me from behind it’s very loose waves, almost straight and it’s so annoying because i want my whole hair to be curly. Try pinning the hair while wet. As counterintuitive as it may be, smooth hair isn�t a good thing when you�re aiming for style to hold. Each curl has a mind of its own.</p>
