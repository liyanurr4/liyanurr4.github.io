<p>What does the bible say about once saved always saved, Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in god’s sight.” At least, the pure version of football, where you play with a pigskin. The bible also in verse 16 of the scripture stated clearly that the long hair of a woman is her glory.</p>
