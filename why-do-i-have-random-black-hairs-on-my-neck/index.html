<p>The root of these single white hairs can also be fluctuating hormones. You should think of them as part of the normal random variation that is present at all levels of our biology, without which evolution would be impossible. The genetic mutations of the hair follicles affect two important cells in the skin, the melanocytes (that produce melanin which gives hair its colour) and the keratinocytes (that produce keratin which is what hair is composed of). As we age, random thick hairs often pop up all over—especially on our chin and neck areas—seemingly in an effort to ruin our lives.</p>

<p>Every single hair strand on your body is produced by a hair follicle, which grows in different phases. As a result, this lone follicle has more time to grow a longer hair. Many medications can cause unwanted hair growth as well, such as cyclosporine, minoxidil, phenytoin and more.” how to get rid of them. Another possibility is that just like long black hair that grows on. Also the decline in oestrogen can make the light blonde fuzzy hair on the cheeks turn dark. I would use a fade cream but when the hair grew back the dark spot would come back.</p>
