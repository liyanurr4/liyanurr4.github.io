<p>I just purchased a puppy 3 month ago, she seems to be very healthy, but she is losing fur in patches and our local vet cannot find anything wrong with her. Most people assume, often incorrectly, that hair loss in squirrels is the result of mange, a disease caused by microscopic mites that burrow into the skin and are unseen by the naked eye. This very dark, near black squirrel appeared at the feeder one day, but didn�t stay. When field dressing a squirrel, it is important to check the condition of the squirrel’s liver. He had a patch of fur missing off one knee, so i suspect he�s a catch and release. Big stripes, utterly hairless, awful.</p>
