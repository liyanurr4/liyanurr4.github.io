<p>I’ve always had blessedly thick hair and i’ve not noticed thinning at. The two main reasons for permed hair not being as curly as desired are, the perm rods used were too large in diameter and produced a wave rather than a curl. Once it�s totally dry, use your fingers to dress the curl out, but be gentle! A fishtail can result if the hair is not wound around the perm rod correctly. Once the stylist removes the curlers, your hair will now be “permanently” curled (which is where the term “perm” comes from). Sometimes when the hair is damaged, the perm will not take.</p>

<p>How To Take Care of Permed Hair? The Hair Essentials, Why won’t my hair hold a perm? I’ve always had blessedly thick hair and i’ve not noticed thinning at.

<p>The Big Curl Why my first ever perm was also my last ever, I guess perms work different for different types of hair. 6 your hair is too clean.
