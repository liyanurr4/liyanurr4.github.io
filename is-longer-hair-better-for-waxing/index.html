While everyone’s skin, hair and pain tolerance varies, this is a general guideline of how long hair has to be in order to maximize your waxing experience.

<p>If the hair is too short, the wax may not be able to grab it. While everyone’s skin, hair and pain tolerance varies, this is a general guideline of how long hair has to be in order to maximize your waxing experience. For me, the longer the hair the better.
