If you favor sleeping on one side or the other, you may be have some erosion of the hair due to rubbing against the pillows or bed linens. If you have hair on one side of the head that appears to grow longer, faster, stronger, or thicker, it may be a matter of normal variance. The proof of this is most apparent in the fact that different hair follicles produce differently colored hairs. My best guess is you possibly sleep on the right side more and are naturally prone to hair loss, because the right side of your hair/head is against the pillow more there is more friction on that side of your head resulting in thinner hair.just like a newborn child when they are born with hair they usually lose the hair wherever their head lays on the pillow the most, or their hair becomes.</p>
