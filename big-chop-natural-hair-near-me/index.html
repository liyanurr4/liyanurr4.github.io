<p>No one told me that my hair type was the most fragile of hair all over the world. There are absolutely no traces of my natural hair in photos or home videos during my childhood years. This is big news because i grew up thinking my hair was the toughest, roughest stuff around. I had a chemical relaxer for as long as i could remember and started wearing weaves as early as middle school. When i big chopped for the first time it was just to get the relaxer out of my hair but for the 2nd time i wanted to play around with some new styles since i know how to take care of my natural hair and know what it needs to flourish. One such contemporary and bold hairstyle is that of big chop.</p>
