Aging is associated with a decrease in myocardial fatty acid utilization and oxidation, as well as a relative increase in myocardial glucose utilization at rest. Your metabolism doesn’t simply slow down as you age, but rather, certain factors change that, in turn, alter it. (both liver mass and blood flow..</p>
