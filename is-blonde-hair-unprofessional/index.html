<p>Pin on Hair, Is it unprofessional for my hair to look wet for the first hour or two of the day?

<p>Pin on FEMALE ACTRESS, Natural hair reminds people’s mindset of slavery, black skin, big lips, wide hips and ebonics.

<p>Like this only with lighter coral too Pink blonde hair, I say the long blonde hair pulled back can look as professional as short. While young adults and teens would say it doesn’t matter. Natural blond colors are perfectly appropriate for any job. Wearing unprofessional hairstyles for men at work is not advisable. Expression through hair can look very different from style to length, etc.</p>

Hair is one of the first things that people judge you by, so it�s pretty unfair to have your hairstyle judged based on how well it fits with your appearance.
