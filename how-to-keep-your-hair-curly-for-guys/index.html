<p>Simply put, hair conditioners allow you to enhance the feel, look and styling of your curls; You can straighten your hair temporarily with a blow dryer and comb or you can use a flat iron in order to achieve straight strands. While combing, make sure to pull the hair up to ensure longer and neater curls. This method will give you some curls if done with wet hair and will help maintain your curls when done dry.
