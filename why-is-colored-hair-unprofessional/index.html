<p>20 Superlative TWA Hairstyles Teeny Weeny Afro Hottest, Hell no, long hair is not unprofessional. Also “strawmans argument” i’ve heared of it. While attitudes are changing regarding colored hair in the workplace, it still isn�t completely accepted from one stylist�s experience.

<p>Gabrielle Union on Her Hair Being Called Unprofessional, Since your hair is one of the most noticeable features about you, it makes sense that it’s under scrutiny right away. It is acceptable for work. Beards aren’t considered unprofessional all the time, in all settings and for all men. The difference is the approach to color.

There are lots of fairly arbitrary things (many aesthetic choices) that are seen as unprofessional and it varies by industry, geography, and company. Unkempt beards are just as unkempt hair and apparel is considered unprofessional, but it’s wildly inaccurate to suggest that all beards are unprofessional.
