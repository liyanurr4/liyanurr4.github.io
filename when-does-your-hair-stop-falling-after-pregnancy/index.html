<p>This is not because each hair strand itself becomes thicker, but because the hair stays longer in the growing phase of its cycle, which means that less hair falls out than usual. All hair has a growth phase, described anagen, and a resting stage, telogen. But as estrogen levels fall after pregnancy, the hairs finally make their exit — all at once.
