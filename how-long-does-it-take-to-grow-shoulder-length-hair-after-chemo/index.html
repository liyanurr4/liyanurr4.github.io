<p>In dec of 11, i decided to just grow my hair out and now i’m about to hit my 2nd yr of growing mt hair out. From experience of growing my own hair, it took 2 years for it to lay on my shoulders. I remember that after ending chemotherapy my hair has also grew strongly and even thicker than it was before the treatments. This will help you to do your own math: Hair may start to regrow on its own 2 to 3 weeks after chemotherapy is completed. I had long hair, so i first cut it myself to shoulder length.</p>
