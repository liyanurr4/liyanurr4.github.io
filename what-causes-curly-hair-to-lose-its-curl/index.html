<p>Curly hair is thought to be better at keeping mammals warmer than just straight hair alone. Unfortunately i can�t say for sure if it was the fact i just started no shampoo routine, henna, or menopause as they all seemed to be around the same time. Caution must be taken when using products with heavier ingredients, higher heat, and harsher chemicals, as the weight of heavy hair treatment can cause loose curls to fall flat much more quickly than the tighter curl, thus losing volume and body. The shape of your hair follicles defines your curl pattern and texture, so when your body goes through a major hormonal overhaul, it can also change the shape of your follicles, thus changing your curl pattern. When straight hair becomes curly this suggests that something is happening to the shape of the hair follicles but no one knows why that happens or what causes. Use the right products, not heat styling.</p>
